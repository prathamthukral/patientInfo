This is a very simple site composed of 2 pages; one for the actual functionality and one for the basic description and use of the site.
This website prompts the user to input their information (ie. name, date of birth, gender, etc.) as a patient in a hospital.
Their data would then appear in the console of the machine saved as various variables.
*Coming soon: The site will use a JSON to send the data to another computer where the information will be outputted to an Augmented Reality headset: The Microsoft Hololens. The headset will be worn by the doctor and shows a small overlay for the doctor to see their next patients information. It uses C++ and also works with voice commands*
